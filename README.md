# OOP-PROJECTS-AND-JAVA-LEARNING

A collection of Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects and learning materials by Muhtasim Apon.

## Project Overview

This repository collects various Java programs, lab assignments, and OOP-learning exercises. The goal is to improve foundational and intermediate skills in Java and OOP. Whether you’re a computer or engineering student or a self-learner, the projects here provide practical experience in applying OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, interfaces, and more.

## Contents & Structure

Here’s a summary of what you’ll find:

- **LAB PROBLEMS**: A folder containing lab assignments by topic (for example, LAB 01, LAB 03)  
  - Each lab includes several individual Java programs that solve common OOP tasks.  
- **OOP Projects**: Example projects written in Java, showing multi-class structure and real-world modeling (such as Parking Lot, Shopping Cart, Library)  
- **Java Learning Files**: Code snippets, exercises, and test files that reinforce Java and OOP basics  
- **.idea/**: IDE configuration files (you can ignore or fork these as needed)  
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview and usage instructions  

## Key Features & What You’ll Learn

- Structuring Java code with packages and classes  
- Implementing inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism  
- Using encapsulation and abstraction to solve real-world problems  
- Creating test cases (JUnit or custom assertions) to check functionality  
- Organizing lab-level projects that have a small scope but meaningful logic  
- Building overall skill for more advanced Java tasks, such as data structures and design patterns  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Java Development Kit (JDK), such as Oracle JDK or OpenJDK (version 11 or higher is recommended)  
- A Java-capable IDE or editor, like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with the Java extension  
- Basic knowledge of Java syntax, including variables, loops, and conditionals
